Imagine the problem. We are doing delivery application for businnes. When we started, we could make deliver only by trucks, but our
company is growing with it's offerings, and now can make deliver both by trucks and ships. In future our company can start making 
delivery by planes or even spaceship, that's why I think we should use patter Factory Method.
