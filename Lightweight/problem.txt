Imagine that we have to create a database of employees. Every employee has name, surname, company and position. Obviously, company and
position fields will repeat many times and we will have to keep many objects which are exactly the same, so I divided employee class into
two smaller classes : Lightweight which includes repeating fields, and Context clas which includes unique states. It is very important
that we have a EmployeeDB class, which keeps all lightweights.
