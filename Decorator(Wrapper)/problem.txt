Imagine that we are developing application, which allows us to notify group of employees about problems or events in our company.
When we started, we only made notifications by email, but now we can do them in facebook, telegram or vk, and every employee can choose
where he wants to get notifications from. Every employee can choose 1 or 2 or 3 sources of notifications, but he still needs to be 
notificated in email. This problem can be solved with pattern Decorator(wrapper).
